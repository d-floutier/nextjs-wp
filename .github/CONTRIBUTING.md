## Development

### Tips to help your PR get approved

1. Make sure your code editor supports real-time linting and has the [recommended extensions](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter/wiki/recommended-extensions) installed
2. [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/) are required for all JavaScript functions
3. Run `yarn build && yarn start` before submitting your PR, to ensure a build will be successful
4. Be courteous in your communications

### Git Workflow

1. Create a `feature` branch off `staging`
2. Work locally adhering to coding standards
3. When ready, open a draft Pull Request on Github
4. When finished, fill out the PR template and publish your PR
5. Your PR must pass assertions and deploy successfully
6. After peer review, the PR will be merged back into `staging`
7. Repeat ‚ôªÔ∏è

### PR Preview Deployments

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/webdevstudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter) is connected to this Github repository and will automatically build and deploy a unique URL for each Pull Request.

Learn more about [Vercel + Github integration](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github).

### Code Linting

This project has several rulesets and uses ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint to enforce standards.

In addition to real-time linting, you could run the following commands in your terminal. These commands are also used by Husky during a commit!

Lint JavaScript:

```bash
yarn run lint:js
```

Lint CSS:

```bash
yarn run lint:css
```

Format your code:

```bash
yarn run format
```

## Storybook

To work with Storybook on your Local, run the following command:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Stories are written in `.mdx` and should be placed next to the component.

[Learn how to write stories for this starter](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter/wiki/component-story).

## Releases

Releases to Production will occur at the end of a bi-weekly sprint or via `hotfixes` as needed.

1. On Github, create a PR off the `/staging` branch against the `/main` branch
2. Copy the WPE Staging environment to WPE Production.
3. On Github, merge `/staging` into `/main`
